Hi, I am Ajay. We work as a team to deliver quality solutions for web scraping and automation projects. After looking into the job description we went ahead and coded a web scraping program that automatically goes to the appexchange website for consultant listing and fetches the required data as you wanted in the google sheet, we have the program running for a while and it's grading the data as I am writing the proposal, please let us know if you'd like to get the data as shown in the image, the current scraped data is in JSON format but it will only take 10-15 minutes to convert it into xlsx/csv format after which we can import it into a google sheet.
